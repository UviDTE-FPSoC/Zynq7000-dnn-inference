Zynq7000-dnn-inference
======================

This repository contains guides to create an application that allows running inference of a Deep Neural Network using a Zynq7000 Xilinx family chip. In the [wiki](https://github.com/UviDTE-FPSoC/Zynq7000-dnn-inference/wiki) of the repository there is guides to install all the needed software, configure the hardware and learn the workflow to create an inference application with the DNNDK v3.1 package of Xilinx.

The contents are:

- **Documentation**: Documentation .pdf files used along the process of creating an inference application.
- **GuideImages**: Images used in the wiki page of the repository.
- **ZedBoard_DNNs**: Contains a folder with all the files needed to set up an inference application on ZedBoard (Vivado and PetaLinux project), as well as seven applications to measure the execution time of four different DNN models with the frameworks Caffe and TensorFlow. The guides to create all of this files can be found in the repository's [wiki](https://github.com/UviDTE-FPSoC/Zynq7000-dnn-inference/wiki) page.
